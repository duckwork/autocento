"Is man the natural thing that makes unnatural things" he thought to himself as he looked out the kitchen window at the shed.
He wondered who built the shed for the first time since he'd been going out there.
"Mom who built the shed out back" he asked.
"That was your father" she said.

His father.
Paul had never met him.
His mother had said when he was a kid that his father was caught by a [riptide][] while swimming in the ocean.
He hadn't noticed what was happening until the land was a thin line on the horizon.
He became exhausted swimming back and drowned.
His body was found a week later by the coroner's estimate.
Paul never really believed this story because his mother's face was sad in the wrong way when she told it.

She said he looked like his father but she also said all men look alike.
Paul realized he'd been standing at the kitchen window for a long time looking out at the shed without realizing it.
He went out to take an inventory of everything inside.

"Where you going" asked his mother.
"To the shed.
I'll be back in a bit" he said.
