| The self is a serengeti
| a wide grassland with baobab trees
| reaching their roots deep into earth
| like a child into a clay pot
| A wind blows there or seems to blow
| if he holds it up to his ear the air shifts
| like stones in a stream uncovering a crawfish
| it finds another hiding place watching you
| Its eyes are blacker than wind
| on the serengeti they are the [eyes of a predator][formal]
| they are coming toward you or receding
| a storm cloud builds on the horizon
| Are you [running][] toward the rain or away from it
| Do you stand still and crouch hoping for silence
