| Inside of my memory, the poem is another memory.
| The air up here is thin, but the wind blows harder
| than anywhere else I know.  It threatens to rip
| my body away, like [an angel of death][], to the stars.

| In Arizona, I thought I would forget the rain,
| forget its sound on a roof like a hard wind, forget
| its smell like a far away ocean.  Luckily for me
| it rains here.  Luckily, because I forget too easily.

| In a dream, [my father is caught by a riptide][] off-shore.
| He's pulled far out, far enough that the shoreline's
| a dim line in his [memory][] on the horizon.  I can see him
| swimming, hand over hand, pulling his small weight

| back to land.  I see him as [another shipwreck][] victim,
| coughing sand and seawater, beard woven with seaweed.
| I see him lying there a long time.  I see all this
| as he tells me the story, years later, the riptide

| only a [ghost][] in his memory, I only a child falling
| asleep.  My mother's making mayonnaise rolls
| in the kitchen, a recipe I'll send for years later,
| in Arizona, in the monsoon season, when my thirst

| pulls me back home, my memory's lonesome twinkle
| like [stars above the mountains][].  I'll send for it
| and try to make them, but at this altitude they'll
| crumble into dust like desert air, like a memory.
