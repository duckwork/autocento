Walking along in the dark is a good way to begin a song.
Walking home in the dark after a long day chasing criminals is another.
Running away from an imagined evil is no way to begin a story.

I am telling you this because you wanted to know what it's like to tell [something so beautiful][] everyone will cry.
I am telling you because I want you to know what it is to keep everything inside of you.
I am telling you.

Can you see?
Can you see into me and reach in your hand and pull me inside out, like an [old shirt][]?
Will you wear me until I unravel on your shoulders, will you cut me apart and use my skin to clean up the [cola you spill][] on the floor when you're drunk?

I want you to know that I want you to know.
Do you want me?
To know is to know.
[I, you want we.][]
We want.
That is why we're here.
To want is to be is to want and I want you.
Do you also?
Check yes or no.

There is a way to end every story, [every song][].
Every criminal must be caught.
Even those who cry dry their tears.
I cannot tell you all I want because I want to tell you everything.
[There is no art because there is no mirror big enough.][]
We wake up every day.
Sometimes we sleep.
