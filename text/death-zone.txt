| When I think of death I think
| of Peter Falk in _The Princess Bride_ patting
| [his pockets][] as he leaves the room

| Life is a series of doors or so
| they say but I ask them this
| where does that last door lead?

| For Falk maybe it leads backstage
| a black-walled catered affair with stage
| lights slowly baking stale muffins

| [Sweaty cheese][] leaking onto dried-out
| grapes a chocolate fountain clogged
| by some errant strawberry crown

| but this is not where it leads for you or
| for me that door opens onto darkness marked
| only by a trellis or the lid of a casket

| the door of the [earth's womb][] opening
| finally to accept us and with us the dirt
| not to grow more strawberries for Falk

| but to pad his feet as he walks overhead
| to visit someone he certainly cares about
| but whose name is lost to posterity.
