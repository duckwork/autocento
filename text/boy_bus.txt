| When he said [Bible][] I heard his southern accent
| and he had a face I expect all pastors must have
| a round open honest face
| that will always be a boy's face
| though its owner may rightly call himself a man
| near my age though I hardly call myself a man

| I have seen this face before whether in life or a dream
| I can't tell
| if I've seen him on the street once
| twice who knows and his pastor's [moon face][]
| reminds me of something
| some distant light my life used to own

| [One night on my birthday the moon was so strong it cast shadows][]
| I could see to the far hill and back it was all clear to me

| The moon hasn't done that in a long time
| [its face has been obscured by clouds][] for weeks
| and that boy on the bus his face I've forgotten
| I thought I recognized a good number of people
| on that bus who I didn't know at all
