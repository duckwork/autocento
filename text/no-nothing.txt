| While [swimming in the river][]
| I saw [underneath it a river][]
| of stars.  Only there was no
| river: it was noon.  You can
| say the sun is a river; you
| can argue the stars back it
| like [shirts behind a closet][]
| door; you can say [the earth][]
| holds us up with its weight
| or that it means well or it
| means anything.
|                 There is no
| closet, [nor door][]; there are
| no shirts hanging anywhere.
| There is no false wall that
| leads deep into the earth's
| bowels, [growing warmer][] with
| each step.  Warmth as a con-
| cept has ceased to make any
| sense.  In contraposition to
| cold, it might, but cold as
| well [stepped out][] last night
| and hasn't returned.
|                      Last I
| heard, it went out swimming
| and [might've drowned][].  Trees
| were the pallbearers at the
| funeral, the train was long
| and wailful, there was much
| [wailing and gnashing][] of all
| teeth--though there were no
| teeth, no train, no funeral
| or prayer or trees at all--
| nor a [river underneath][] any-
| thing.  There was nothing to
| be underneath anymore.
|                        Look
| around, and tell me you see
| something.  Look around, and
| tell me something that I do
| not know.  I know, more than
| anything, that the world is
| always ending.  Behind that,
| there is nothing, save that
| there is no nothing either.
|
| Nothing somehow still turns
| and flows past us, past all
| time and beyond it, a river
| returning, to its forgotten
| origins deep within itself.
