| Silence lies underneath us all in the same way
| [the Nile has a river underneath ten times as large][nile]
| (although this is an urban legend, apparently).

| So underneath [truth][] or legend, flowing by
| the feel of their own [silence][], move the stars:
| silence lies underneath us all in the same way.

| [John Cage][433], I think, understood this: the way
| that, in a silent room, one still hears the nerves
| (although this is an urban legend, apparently),

| or the heart, which I find more easily
| believable: there simply is no way that, by and large,
| silence lies underneath us all in the same way.

| There must be different silences, because we
| have different [songs][] to drown them out, different gods
| (although these are urban legends, apparently).

| But is not all [sound one sound][]?  You and I
| are two faces to the same head, the same body.
| Silence lies underneath us all in the same way---
| although this is an urban legend, apparently.
