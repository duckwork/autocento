| It was a [gamble][]
| I lost---thought I could get closer
| than the library, stayed
| on past the admin building,
| back down the hill to my beginning,
| the driver's second-to-last stop.
| [I have to walk now][],
| through the wind and sun, past
| [traffic][] moving merrily along
| taking their own gambles
| staying on or getting off
| too soon.
