Paul took his axe and went out into the woods to chop trees.
Or rather he went into the trees to chop wood.
He wasn't sure.
Either way it helped him think.
Last time he'd gone out, he'd had an idea for a shoe-insert company he could start called "Paul's Bunyons."
He chuckled to himself as he shouldered his axe and went into the forest.

Deep into the woods he admired the organization of the trees.
"They grow wherever they fall" he said "but still none is too close to another."
He sounded like Solomon to himself.
[He imagined he had a beard.][]

He walked for a long time in the shadows of the forest, in its coolness.
It sounded like snow had fallen but it was still [October][].
The first time the trees seemed to radiate out from him in straight lines he stopped and turned around four times.
After he walked on he noticed it happened fairly often.

Still, after he felled his first tree that day he realized they grew from the epicenter of his axe.
He paused in the [small dark sound][] of the forest quiet.
