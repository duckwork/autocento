"What do you mean."

"Oh right.
Sure thing."
They pulled into the parking lot.
"Just be a minute" he said as he opened the car door.

He walked under the door resplendent in its King William orange and white.
He saw the towering rows of shelves like mountain ridges in Hell.
He strolled among the fixtures, pipes, planks, sheets, plants (Why plants? he thought), switches.

He turned around and walked straight out of the store and to his mother's car without looking up.

"How'd it go" she asked starting the car.
"Great" he said.
