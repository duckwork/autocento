| Now the ticking clocks scare me.
| The [empty][] rooms, clock towers, belfries;
| I am terrified by them all.

| I really used to enjoy going to church,
| singing in the choir, listening to the sermon.
| Now the chairs squeal like dying pigs---

| It was the boar that did it.
| [Fifteen feet][] from me that night
| in the grass, rooting for God
| knows what, finding me instead.

| I ran, not knowing where or how,
| not looking for his pursuit of me.
| I ran to God's front door, found
| it locked, found the [house][] empty

| with a note saying, "Condemned."
