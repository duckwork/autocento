    title: Autocento of the breakfast table
    class: autocento
...

| Bottom of the drink: they had
| to go.  The Coke machine, the snack
| machine, the deep fryer.  Hoisted

| and dragged through the halls
| and out to the curb, they sat with
| other trash beneath gray, forlorn

| skies behind the elementary
| school, wondering what their next
| move would be.  The Coke machine

| had always wanted to live
| the life of a [hobo][], jumping trains,
| eating from garbage, making fire

| in old oil drums.  It had some
| strange romantic notions of being homeless,
| is what the deep fryer thought.

| Its opinion was to head to court,
| sue the bastards at the school for early
| termination of contract.  It was

| the embodiment of [justifiable anger][].
| It believed privately that it was an incarnation
| of Nemesis, the goddess of divine

| retribution.  What the snack machine
| thought, it kept to itself, but it did say
| that [nothing ever ends][].  The others

| were confused, then angry, but finally
| understood, or thought they did.  The snack
| machine's candy melted in the sun.
