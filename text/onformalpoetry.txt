| I think that I could write formal poems
| exclusively, or at least inclusive
| with all the other stuff I write
| I guess.  Of course, I've already written
| a few, this one included, though "formal"
| is maybe a stretch.  Is blank verse a form?
| What is form anyway?  I picture old
| women counting [stitches on their knitting][knitting],
| keeping iambs next to iambs in lines
| as straight and sure as arrows.  But my sock
| is lumpy, poorly made: it's beginning
| to unravel.  Stresses don't line up.  Syl-
| lables forced to fit like [McNugget][] molds.
| That cliché on the arrow?  I'm aware.
| My prepositions too---God, where's it stop?
| The answer: never.  I will never stop
| writing poems, or hating what I write.
