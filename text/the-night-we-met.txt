| My head is [full of fire][], my tongue swollen,
| pregnant with all the things I should've said
| but didn't.  Last night, we met each other
| in the dark, remember?  You told me time was

| pregnant with all things.  I should've said
| something, to draw you out from your safety
| in the dark.  Remember, you told me time was
| only an illusion, [and memory was][] only

| something to draw.  You, out from your safety,
| I out from mine, that night, I believed in you.
| And illusion and memory were one, lying
| [down on your couch][], through the night you drew

| me out from mine.  That night, I believed in you
| when you told me you loved me.  I lay
| down on your couch.  Through the night, you drew
| a picture of our [future together][].

| When you told me you loved me, I lied
| [in the dark][].  Remember, you told me time was
| [a picture of our future][] together.
| My head is full of fire, [my tongue swollen][].
