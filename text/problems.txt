The problem with people is this: we cannot be happy.
No matter how hard or easy we try, it is not to be.
It seems sometimes that, just as the dog was made for jumping in mud and sniffing out foxholes and having a good time all around, man was made for sadness, loneliness and heartache.

Being the observant and judgmental people they are, people have for a long time tried to figure out why they aren't happy.
Some say it's because we're obviously doing something wrong.
Some say it's because we think too much.
Some insist that it's because other people have more stuff than we do.
These people don't have a clue any more than any of the rest of us.
At least I don't think they do, and that's good enough for me.[^1]
I think that the reason why people are unhappy (and this is a personal opinion) is that they realize on some level (for some it's a pretty shallow level, others it's way down there next to their love for women's stockings[^2]) that there is no background to put themselves against, no "[big picture][]" to get painted into.
This makes sense, because on one level, the level of everyday life, the level of *observation*, there is always a background---look in a pair of binoculars sometime.
But on another level, that of ... shit, wait.
There are no other levels.[^3]

What's more, people try to explain how to get happy again (although it's doubtful they were ever happy in the first place---people are very good at fooling).
Some say standing or [sitting in a building][] with a lot of other unhappy people helps.
Some say that you can't stop there; you also need to sing with those other unhappy people about how unhappy you are, and how you wish someone would come along and help you out, I guess by giving you money or something.
I say all you really need to be happy is a good stiff drink.[^4]

In any case, people have for some reason or another, and to some end or another, always been unhappy.
And people have always tried to figure out ways to be less unhappy---one of the most important things to people everywhere is called "the pursuit of happiness."
I think that calling it a pursuit makes people feel more like dogs, who are the most happy beings most people can think of.
By pursuing happiness, they're like a dog pursuing a possum or a bone on a fishing rod: two activities that sound like a lot of fun to most people.
I think most people wish they were dogs.

    Yes, this is just like Super Mario Brothers---you can skip right to
