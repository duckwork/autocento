_Apparently typewriters need ribbon._
_Apparently ribbon is incredibly hard to find anymore because no one uses typewriters.
Apparently I am writing my hymns from now on._
So he was back to calling his notes "hymns."
He looked up "hymns" in the dictionary.
It said that a hymn was "an ode or song of praise or adoration."
Praise or adoration to what? he asked himself.
He thought maybe furniture.
There was still a lot of notfurniture in what he was again calling his Writing Shack.

The dictionary also had this to say about "hymn": that it was possibly related to the old Greek word for "[weave][]."
"[Weave what][]" Paul wondered to himself.
He wrote this down on a new notecard.
_Apparently "hymn" means weave somehow.
Or it used to.
Or its cousin did.
What is it weaving?
Who is it weaving for?
I remember in school we talked about Odysseus and his wife Penelope, who wove a tapestry every day just to take it apart at night.
I forget why._

_Maybe she wove the tapestry for Odysseus.
Maybe she wove it for herself.
What did she weave it of?
[Memory][], maybe?
[Or dream][]?
I think these words make a kind of tapestry, or at least the thread it will be made of.
I will weave a hymn to the gods of Literature, out of fiction.
My furniture was a try at weaving, but I am shit at furniture.
So writing it is again._

He wrote _**NOTES FOR A HYMN**_ at the top of this notecard.
