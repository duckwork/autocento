| [The moon is drowning][] the stars it pushes them
| under into the darkness they cannot breathe
| they are flailing the moon boasts to my shadow
| how powerful is the moon how great its light

| My shadow nods and calls the moon father though
| it acknowledges also the existence of others
| headlights are like little moons father my shadow says
| they pass like waves in a dark ocean

| Father moon becomes angry and threatens
| I can maroon you shadow I can trap you in darkness
| your strength comes from my own the little moons
| are fleeting like foam on a darkened sea

| My shadow fears the night as it fears death
| but it remembers the moon's strength is from another
| my shadow wants the headlights like an ocean
| might want the moon as a seducer as a lover
