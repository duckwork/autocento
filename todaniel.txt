| There are more modern ideals of beauty
| than yours, young padawan.  Jessica has
| some assets, that I'll give you easily,
| but in my women I prefer pizzazz.

| I don't want to bring you down, or make you think
| [that your perfected woman isn't so][trumpet].
| It's just that, like Adam said, 2006
| has come and gone.  What did she do

| in that year anyway?  IMDB
| has, surprisingly, none, though in '05
| she's in four titles.  _Sin City_
| I've never seen, although from many I've

| heard it's good.  But it's still irrelevant---
| no matter how comely, she lacks talent.
