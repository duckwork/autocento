| So two hyperintelligent pandimensional beings
| walk into a bar.  One turns to the other and says,
| "Did you remember to check the end state
| of that simulation we were running?"  The other
| says, "No, I thought that you did?"  To which
| the first replies, "[Oh shit][], we missed it.
| I suppose we must do all of this again.  Barkeep,

| two beers please."  The bartender nods in that way
| that bartenders do, pours the two beers,
| expertly, by the way, just so, and hands them
| to the first [hyperintelligent pandimensional][] being.
| The second one pulls a few singles out of his
| wallet, places them on the bar, and the pair
| turn around and begin walking toward a table
| in the middle of the mostly-empty bar.  The bar-
| tender picks up the money, fans it out, frowns,
| and calls to his patrons' backs: "Hey, this
| isn't enough!"  The two turn around simultan-
| eously, with parity, and stare at him.  A beat.

| One of them, the one without the beer, breaks
| the silence by exclaiming, "Oh dear god, I'm
| sorry!  I didn't know your prices went up since
| last time.  What do I owe you?"  The bartender
| says, "Oh, just another [dollar][]-fifty."  The being
| reaches in his back pocket, slides out his
| wallet, looks in smiling, and frowns when he sees
| it's empty.  He looks to the other and says,
| "You got a [buck][]-fifty I can borrow?"

| The second hyperintelligent pandimensional being
| considers this.  He sets the beers down
| on the table, pulls out his own wallet, opens
| it, and frowns.  "I'm broke too," he says.
