| January.
| It's cold, and I don't like it.
| I prefer warm weather,
| although I like sweaters.  They are the one
| warm spot in an otherwise [shitty][] season.
| But fall is better sweater weather.  So be patient,

| _patient_,
| while waiting for the end of January.
| A change of season
| brings a change of mood along with it,
| although I never thought I'd be one
| to believe that [SAD][] junk about effects of weather---

| weather!---
| on a person.  Who becomes a patient
| just because of one
| [month of snow][]?  I did say of January:
| "It's cold, and I don't like it,"
| but I hardly think it's fair, knocking whole seasons,

| seasoning
| your conversation with demands for better weather.
| (While I find it
| nearly impossible, it's my mission to be patient
| while waiting for the end of January.)
| Oh, but how the long nights do so [tax][] one!

| One
| [warm spot][] in an otherwise shitty season---
| all I ask, January,
| is one warm day.  Do you care whether
| I'm a person who becomes a patient
| in some psych ward?  This just about does it.

| I.T.,
| although I never thought I'd call one,
| is fair and patient
| when I call.  They talk with me, season
| my conversation of demands for better weather
| with an argument for the white beauty of January.

| They know it's hard; they say each season
| has its detractors.  _One day_, they say, _the weather
| will be controlled---until then, patience in January_.
