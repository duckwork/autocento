"Hello Paul this is Jill Jill Noe remember me" the voice on the phone was a woman's.
He nodded into the receiver.
"Hello" Jill asked again "hello?"
Paul remembered that phones work by talking and said "Hello Jill."

"Do you remember me" she asked "we were in school together?
How have you been?"
"Pretty well" said Paul "I've been writing and making furniture."
"Oh that's nice" [said the woman's voice][] tinny in the phone
"Listen I ran into your mother at the [Supermarket][] the other day and she said you need a job.
You still need one?"
Paul had to tell the truth.
His mother was watching him out of the corner of her eye as she was playing dominoes at the kitchen table.
"Yes" he said sighing "Although woodworking takes up much of my time."

"OK" she laughed uncomortably "I actually have something you could do for me if you think you can get away from woodworking a bit.
It's just data entry really basic stuff entry-level."
"What's it pay" he asked.
"Minimum but there is room for movement."
"OK" he said.
"Start on Monday okay?"
"Sure" he said "bye" and the tin voice in the phone said "Goodbye Paul see you" by the time he put it back on the hook.

"Who was that" asked his mother.
"Jill Noe" he said.
"Oh her was she calling about a job for you?"
"Yes starts Monday" he said.
She smiled behind her glasses reflecting dominoes.
