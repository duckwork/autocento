| After searching for days or even months
| I finally find it reclining lazily
| [above the peaks][] above the city as if to ask
| Did you miss me?  Yes very much I reply
| and rush to embrace it but it smiles
| and recoils and tells me No no you
| have to try harder than that it says
| I do not give myself up so easily

| I try a different tack
| I sing to it bring it flowers nightly
| I compare its eyes to the morning dew
| it has not seen the morning dew
| I say its mouth is the sunset over mountains
| it knows mountains but the sunset
| is only a rumor from the Evening Star
| I tell the Big Dipper that it moves
| [like a quiet river across the earth][]

| Rivers I have seen says the Big Dipper
| they sparkle in the light from my stars
| Your stars like eyes I say and it smiles
| [No it says that is too easy][]
| It turns its back
| it walks home along the back of the mountain
