| I thought I saw you walking
| to the bus stop but it was only
| a [raven][].  His croaks sounded nothing
| like your footsteps (as they pound
| down the hallway toward my bedroom)
| his [wings][] looked nothing like your
| legs (running on the wrong side
| of the road away from my house)
| I think the one resemblance was the eyes

| But that's too easy
| It's just that I was thinking
| of you and a raven flew by
| (maybe it was a [crow][])
