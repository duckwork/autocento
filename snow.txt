_[I don't care if they burn][]_ he wrote on his last blank notecard.
He'd have to go to the Office Supply Store tomorrow after work.

He looked at what he'd written.
He'd been thinking about this for a while, felt the frustration build slowly like a [thundercloud][] in the back of his mind.
He thought he should write something else on the card, but everything he thought of seemed too confessional or too real compromising.
[He didn't want anyone, not even the notecards, to know what he was thinking.][thinking]
He decided to try for more of an interview with the paper.

_Why?_  asked the notecard.
_Because there is nothing important on any of them_ he wrote back.
_What do you mean?
You have some good stuff in that top drawer there._
He looked in the top drawer.
It was stuffed full of notecards in no organization.
He could see bits and pieces of thoughts like leaves crunched underfoot in autumn.
_It will take so much organization_ he wrote.

_Why is organization important?
Remember the trees, [how they formed rows][] without trying.
No matter how the ideas fall, they make something.
[The snow][] [does that too][]_ he wrote.
_It doesn't try to make anything but it does._

_No the snow is different_ the notecard was annoyed.
_The snow is a blank canvas that humans build into shapes or doppelgangers.
It makes nothing on its own._
