| I can walk through the rain, [that rare occurrence][]
| and never be hit by a drop.  There is a space around me
| that refuses to be [penetrated][] by weather of any kind
| be it rain or snow or sunshine.  [Is it cold I hear you][]
| asking in your voice soft as a breeze.  No it is not
| [particularly cold][].  If I were to describe it as warm
| [I would be lying as well][].  If I were to pretend I heard
| you, far-off, mirage, breeze on the horizon, [no truth][]
| would ever be said to have come from [my frozen lips][].
