| On your desk I set a tangerine:
| a relic of a [winter][] quickly passing.

| I'm reminded, fiercely, of a summer:
| I watched the [cemetery grass][] on my stomach.

| You hate the wind [blowing through buildings][]:
| the coldness of fire, blister of a mountain stream.

| When you broke down that night: your aunt / you
| never have been / [you shook that night][] /

| Seasonal affective disorder is real: you
| [mutter under your breath on the highway][].

| The ant carries an orange peel past a headstone:
| it carries her nearly as often.

| I set a tangerine on your desk:
| an engagement ring, winter-returned.
