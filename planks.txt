He stared at it, sipping at his too-hot coffee.
This made sense to him.

He looked at the spot on the wall where he wanted a window to be, at the rough planks above his desk as they were lit by the bare hanging lightbulb.
He sipped his coffee again.

He threw open the door to the snow and the ground below it.
He reached for his axe on the wall.
He reconsidered.
