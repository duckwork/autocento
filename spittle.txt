...

| My body is attached to your body by a thin spittle of thought.
| When you turn away from me, my thought is broken
| and forms anew with something else.  Ideas are drool.
| Beauty has been slobbered over far too long.  [God][]
| is a tidal wave of bodily fluid.  Even the flea has some
| vestigial wetness.  We live in a world fleshy and dark,
| and moist as a nostril.  Is conciousness only a watery-eyed
| romantic, crying softly into his [shirt-sleeve][]?  Is not reason
| a square-jawed businessman with a briefcase full of memory?
| I want to kiss the world to make it mine.  I want to become
| a Judas to reality, betray it with the wetness of emotion.
