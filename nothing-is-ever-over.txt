| [Nothing is ever over][]; nothing
| is ever even begun.  The foundation
| hasn't been laid; how can we hope
| to put in the plumbing?  The bed
| is unmade, not even made; the wood
| [hasn't been cleft from the tree][];
| the seed hasn't been cast
| out of water and growth and sun,
| which itself hasn't started shining.
| The cock has never stopped crowing
| because he never started.  Peter
| [betrays us again][] and again with
| silence.  Christ wakes up at night,
| [choking from a bad dream][], wrists
| aching from a dreamt, torturous pain.
