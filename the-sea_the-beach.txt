| Waiting for a reading to start
| when there's nobody coming anyway
| is like waiting [for the tide][]
| to make some meaning of the beach.

| The sea doesn't know or care
| what the beach even is, let alone
| its cares or its troubles, its
| little nagging under-the-skin annoyances
| [that make the beach the beach][].

| Sandworms, for example, or those crabs
| with big pincers on one side
| but not the other.  Those really get
| the beach's gander up, but the sea
| doesn't care.  The sea

| only wants to [caress][] the beach
| with its [soft arms][], to tell the beach
| how much it's loved by the sea,
| that complex of water, salt, and
| the moon's gravity, the mercury
| rising up and down slowly, like a [yawn][].

| The sea only cares about itself.
| The beach lays there and takes it.
