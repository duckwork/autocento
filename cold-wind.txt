| [Man of autumn][], cold wind,
| blow down the trees' leaves.
| [Fire on the ground][].  The sky is
| perfect water, frost-cold,
| rippled only by flocks
| [of black birds][] flying and gone.
| Their brightness can blind
| an uncareful watcher, work him
| [in a froth of hands][], not-wings
| that ache with the loss of flight.
| A tear is flung faithfully
| [to the ocean of air][], slipping in
| slowly, is as gone as the birds.
