Paul pushed his chair away from the [Writing Desk][] and stared at the notecard.
He stood up, knocked his head on the lightbulb, swore.
He pulled the notecard from his typewriter and crumpled it up with his left hand.
With his right hand he reached in his pocket and pulled out his cigarettes.
He put one in his mouth, threw the paper in the corner, grabbed his axe, went out into the woods.
