...

| I only write poems on [the bus][] anymore.
| I sit far in the back to be alone.
| I mark black things on white things in a black thing.
| I try to make sense of it.

| Every time I see a plastic bag in the wind I think:
| [This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.][]
| Most of my life I relate to something on the TV:
| This is how I try to make sense of it.

| The Talking Heads song ["Stop Making Sense"][stop]
| is about a girlfriend caught cheating and willed oblivion.
| The song's real title is "Girlfriend is Better"
| but [lying][] about it is a way I try to make sense of it.

| The day after I lost her I found you again.
| Your face made a plastic bag of my heart.
| Your eyes were [the wind][] pushing the bus forward.
| I couldn't make sense of it.
